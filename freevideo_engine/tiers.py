"""The quality levels, defined once.

Every entry (editor, Agent API, ComfyUI capabilities, estimates, docs) reads
its level -> plan mapping from here; tests/test_tiers.py checks the entries
that cannot import it (web JS, prose docs) against this table.

- light: two-pass, 8 + 3 steps, first pass at half size (2x learned upscale).
- medium: two-pass, 8 + 3 steps, a larger first pass (`upscale`, below 2).
- high: one pass of 16 steps with the guarded audio-video EasyCache.
- max: one pass of 20 steps with the same guarded cache.

Each level uses the step count in the table below. Only a two-pass level
samples a second time. Single-pass levels carry REFINE_STEPS only as the neutral value the `refine_steps` field
needs; it is never run for them, and their `upscale` is 2 (no factor).
`step_cache` is the engine's cache key: None, 'easycache-av' (audio-video
EasyCache) or 'fbcache' (first-block cache, no level uses it; a request may
still ask for it). `upscale` is the two-pass learned upscale factor
(two_pass.SCALES): change medium's number here, and everything follows.

Mac (MPS) runs the same levels (TIERS_MAC). Results made before the
audio-video EasyCache was ported there, one pass of 16 steps without a cache,
still count as high (LEGACY_MAC_HIGH). Earlier one-pass 20-step results
without a cache still count as max on every platform (LEGACY_MAX).
